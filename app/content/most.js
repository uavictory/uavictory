          Reportedly some 'elite' members of Chechen clown-master Ramzan Kadyrov's forces were

          We should also mention that, unlike Kadyrov's clowns, many brave Chechens are renewing 
          their independence struggle against Russia, and fighting and dying both for the freedom 
          of Ukraine and their own.
