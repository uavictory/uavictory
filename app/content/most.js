          seemed more like a bunch of lost circus performers, rather than the

          No one expected this from (admittedly a very well-educated capable) former
          comedian, least of all Putin who, despite tyrannizing Russia and
          the world for over 20 years, is clearly overmatched.

          To help the Russian invasion forces reach their objectives, the

          Reportedly some 'elite' members of Chechen clown-master Ramzan Kadyrov's forces were
          sent to assassinate Zelensky before they themselves were eliminated. Since then, Russia's
          Chechen units have taken to Tik-Tok, making videos of themselves 'fighting' against enemies
          like...traffic lights and empty building. Clown parade.
        </p>
        <p>
          We should also mention that, unlike Kadyrov's clowns, many brave Chechens are renewing 
          their independence struggle against Russia, and fighting and dying both for the freedom 
          of Ukraine and their own.
