        We don't like to lose any more than anyone else, but we'd gladly
        lose to Valeriya, who plays for contributions to the Ukrainian

        Valeriya is a world champion in checkers in the girls under-10 division.

        So we were quandrying whether the crew at Russian State TV had
        dethroned the Kadyrovis as Clown Champions of the War.
      </p>
      <p>
        On further reflection, we conclude two very distinct talents are at work here: 
        the rugged, slapdash Kady style, and the geo-politishno-metaphysifantashistik 
        artistry of O Skabeeva & Co.
      </p>

        Each should be given their due! So we ordain the Kadyrs retain their Clown title,

        the War category.

        Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill, otherwise known as Putin's

        Perhaps the water on the floor really was holy, and couldn't bear the
