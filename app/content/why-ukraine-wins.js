    Does anyone still believe Ukraine can't win? Maybe Henry Kissinger. The Russians don't
    believe it. Just listen to the intercepts from their soldier. Or the increasingly 
    hysterical claims made on Russian prime time media about having to de-militarize all of 
    Nato. The Russians know reality. It's too much to bear. So they retreat into fantasy land.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Russians are fighting for the delusion of a renewed Russian Empire -- a delusion many
    Russians would welcome were it free, but for which few are willing to pay. Give the soldiers 
    a choice, and most would go home.

    The Ukrainians are fighting for their land, their homes, their families.
    Their whole society is represented in the field: teachers, musicians, boxers, professors, 
    MPs, even a Supreme Court Justice. The leadership of Zelenskyy, Kuleba, Zaluzhnyi makes
    Putin, Shoigu and cronies look like a clown parade. Ukrainian soldiers are tougher,
    smarter and know how to take initiative. They are running circles around their low-morale
    centrally-micromanaged Russian counterparts.

    None of this matters when one side has a huge advantage in guns. Without support,
    Ukrainian forces would be ground down by the huge, shambling Russian army, and
    stalemate would be the best hope.

    But the military equation has changed. Russia is suffering unsustainable losses,
    and much of their lost equipment is being captured and reused by 
    Ukraine. Add to this the huge quantities of heavy Western weapons -- including 
    longer-range artillery and MLRS -- and the prospects for the Russian army 
    are grim indeed. The ZSU estimates the tide will turn in August, and the hot 
    phase of the war will be done by year end. We think things will happen sooner. 
    But either way don't doubt: Україна переможе.
