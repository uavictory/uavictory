    Does anyone still believe Ukraine can't win? Maybe Henry Kissinger. The Russians don't
    believe it. Just listen to the intercepts from their soldier. Or the increasingly strident
    hysterical claims made on Russian prime time media about having to de-militarize all of 
    Nato. They know reality, but it's too much to bear and they've retreated into fantasy land.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Russians are fighting for a delusion of a renewed Russian Empire -- a delusion many
    would welcome were it free, but for which few are willing to pay. Give the soldiers 
    a choice, and most would go home.

    The Ukrainians are fighting for their land, their homes, their families, their existence.
    Their whole society is represented in the field: teachers, musicians, boxers, professors, 
    MPs, even a Supreme Court Justice. The leadership of Zelenskyy, Kuleba, Zaluzhnyi makes
    Putin, Shoigu and cronies look like a clown parade. Ukrainian soldiers are tougher,
    smarter and know how to take initiative. They are running circles around their low-morale
    centrally-micromanaged Russian counterparts.

    None of this matters when one side has a huge advantage in military equipment. Without support,
    for the Ukrainians, the huge shambling Russian military machine would grind out a stalemate
    at the very least, and maybe even Putin's Novarussiya fantasyland stretching to Transniestra.

    But the military equation has changed. Russia is suffering unsustainable losses
    of men and euqipment, and many of that equipment is being captured and reused by the 
    Ukraininas. Add to this the huge quantities of heavy Western weapons -- including 
    longer-range artillery and MLRS -- and the prospects for the demoralized Russian army 
    look grim indeed. The ZSU is estimating the tide will turn in August and the hot 
    phase of the war will be done at year end. We think things will happen sooner, 
    but either way, don't doubt: Україна переможе.
